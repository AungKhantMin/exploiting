## Babyecho writeup
We start by setting a breakpoint just at the beginning of the loop in <code>0x08048fb6</code>where a buffer of 1023 bytes is passed into <code>eax</code> register. We continue one step and we can see how it compares the default value of 13 bytes with the eax register.
<pre><code>gefâž¤  x/xw $esp+0x10
0xbffff1a0:	0x0000000d</code></pre>
But if we continue we see how to set the default value to 13 bytes and then read the string Default 13 bytes <code>0x80be5f1</code>, therefore we must overwrite the variable in some way.
After the first call the next function is <code>fread</code> and we have to pass some input. The best way to interact with our application is to see in our input vector and see its output.
<pre><code>naivenom@ubuntu:~/Desktop/baby/babyecho$ ./babyecho 
Reading 13 bytes
%x.%x.%x.%x 
d.a.0.d</code></pre>
So what we can observe is a kind of format string vulnerability. It is very interesting to understand this vulnerability well since it allows us to control writing or reading of memory. In a basic example we have this function <code>printf(Hi %s, pointer)</code> The function replaces the format with the first argument being a pointer to where the string is contained.

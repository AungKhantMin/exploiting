# Exploits
The purpose of this repository is to be able to share all the challenges that I have been doing during my study about exploiting. I have a private telegram group for learning exploiting and doing livestream videos!. If you want to join you can contact with me in <a href="https://twitter.com/naivenom">Twitter</a>

Pwnable.kr exploits and writeups are protected with password. This password it's just the flag of challenge so pwned for fun and you can take a look of this!

# Buffer Overflow overwriting a cte value and bypass check because of strcpy (Part 2)
<b>Overview</b>
- Our buffer has a 200 bytes of size ebp+Dest and use strcpy() function to copy 210 bytes from other buffer ebp+Dst to the previous one, so we can overflow and write at least one byte to bypass check cmp dword ptr [eax+0C8h], 0

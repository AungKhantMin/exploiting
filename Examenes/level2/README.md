# Buffer Overflow overwriting random value with bypass jl condition
<b>Overview</b>
- Our buffer has a 200 bytes of size <code>ebp+Dest</code> and use <code>strcpy()</code> function to copy 210 bytes from other buffer <code>ebp+Dst</code> to the previous one so we can overflow and write at least one byte to bypass check.
